# Social_Network_Analysis
SNA is the application of network science to social networks, which examines the linkages
between an individual's behavior and the macro-level pattern of relationships. The research
endeavors to graph the foundation as a simple and useful representation by incorporating data
visualization techniques. The research has established numerous metrics to describe and
contrast network structures and positions, such as centrality, density clusters, structurally
equivalent networks, and unique locations. By analyzing their effectiveness for engagement,
the comparison of network topologies as a whole is possible.
